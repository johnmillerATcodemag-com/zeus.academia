- [ ] Prepare sample files for upload demonstration
- [ ] Have mock student data populated in the system
- [ ] Test all navigation paths beforehand
- [ ] Prepare backup scenarios if features aren't working

#### **During the Demo**:

- [ ] Keep each section to the time limits specified
- [ ] Ask stakeholders questions to keep them engaged
- [ ] Highlight business value, not just technical features
- [ ] Be prepared to go deeper on features that generate interest
- [ ] Have test results ready to show development quality

#### **Stakeholder Engagement Questions**:

- _"How does this compare to your current course management process?"_
- _"Which of these features would save you the most time?"_
- _"What additional functionality would you like to see?"_
- _"How would this integrate with your existing systems?"_

### **Technical Demo Notes**

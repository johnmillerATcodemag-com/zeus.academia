## 🏛️ Domain Model

The system is built around key academic domain concepts:

### Core Aggregates

- **Student**: Manages student information, enrollment status, and academic records
- **Course**: Represents academic courses with prerequisites and capacity limits
- **Enrollment**: Tracks student course enrollments with grades and attendance
- **Program**: Academic degree programs with curriculum requirements
- **Faculty**: Faculty members and their teaching assignments

### Key Business Rules

- Students must be in active status to enroll in courses
- Courses have capacity limits and prerequisite requirements
- Grades can only be assigned by faculty teaching the course
- Academic terms have enrollment periods with deadlines

## 🔧 Development

### Building the Project

```bash
# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Build solution
dotnet build

# Run tests
dotnet test
```

### Code Quality

The project maintains high code quality standards:

- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 85% for unit tests
- **Static Analysis**: SonarCloud integration with quality gate
- **Code Style**: EditorConfig and .NET analyzers enforce consistent formatting

### Git Workflow

We follow the GitFlow branching model:

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: Feature development branches
- `release/*`: Release preparation branches
- `hotfix/*`: Critical production fixes

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Example:

```
feat(enrollment): add capacity validation for course enrollment

- Validate course capacity before allowing student enrollment
- Throw DomainException when capacity is exceeded
- Add comprehensive unit tests for validation logic

Closes #123
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Component README Template
```markdown
# Academia.Application

This assembly contains the Application Layer of the Academia Management System, implementing the CQRS pattern with MediatR for command and query handling.

## Architecture

The Application Layer serves as the orchestration layer between the Domain and Infrastructure layers, containing:

- **Commands & Queries**: Request/response models for CQRS operations
- **Handlers**: Business logic orchestration and domain interaction
- **Behaviors**: Cross-cutting concerns via MediatR pipeline behaviors
- **Validators**: Input validation using FluentValidation
- **DTOs**: Data transfer objects for external communication

## Key Patterns

### Command Handler Example

```csharp
public class EnrollStudentInCourseCommandHandler : IRequestHandler<EnrollStudentInCourseCommand, Result<EnrollmentId>>
{
    public async Task<Result<EnrollmentId>> Handle(EnrollStudentInCourseCommand request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Handler implementation
    }
}
````

### Validation Behavior

All commands and queries are validated using FluentValidation through a pipeline behavior:

```csharp
public class ValidationBehavior<TRequest, TResponse> : IPipelineBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>
{
    // Validation implementation
}
```

## Dependencies

- MediatR: CQRS pattern implementation
- FluentValidation: Input validation
- Academia.Domain: Domain model access
- Academia.Shared: Common utilities

## Usage

Register services in DI container:

```csharp
services.AddMediatR(typeof(EnrollStudentInCourseCommandHandler).Assembly);
services.AddValidatorsFromAssembly(typeof(EnrollStudentInCourseCommandValidator).Assembly);
```

Send commands/queries through mediator:

```csharp
var command = new EnrollStudentInCourseCommand(studentId, courseId, term);
var result = await _mediator.Send(command, cancellationToken);
```

# ADR-001: Use CQRS Pattern with MediatR

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Academia Management System requires handling complex business operations that involve reading and writing data with different performance characteristics and business rules. We need to separate command operations (writes) from query operations (reads) to:

- Optimize read and write operations independently
- Implement complex business logic without affecting query performance
- Enable different scaling strategies for reads and writes
- Facilitate better testing and maintainability

## Decision

We will implement the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern using the MediatR library for .NET.

### Key Components:

- **Commands**: Represent write operations that change system state
- **Queries**: Represent read operations that return data without side effects
- **Handlers**: Process commands and queries with business logic
- **MediatR**: Provides in-process messaging and request/response handling

## Consequences

### Positive:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between read and write operations
- **Performance Optimization**: Queries can be optimized independently of commands
- **Testability**: Handlers can be unit tested in isolation
- **Scalability**: Read and write sides can be scaled independently
- **Flexibility**: Different data models for reads and writes
- **Maintainability**: Business logic is centralized in handlers

### Negative:

- **Complexity**: Additional abstraction layer increases initial complexity
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand CQRS patterns and MediatR
- **Overhead**: Small operations may have unnecessary indirection
- **Eventual Consistency**: Potential for read/write model synchronization issues

### Neutral:

- **Code Volume**: More files and classes but better organization
- **Performance**: Potential overhead offset by optimization opportunities

## Implementation Details

### Command Example:

```csharp
public class EnrollStudentInCourseCommand : IRequest<Result<EnrollmentId>>
{
    public StudentId StudentId { get; }
    public CourseId CourseId { get; }
    public AcademicTerm AcademicTerm { get; }
}

public class EnrollStudentInCourseCommandHandler : IRequestHandler<EnrollStudentInCourseCommand, Result<EnrollmentId>>
{
    public async Task<Result<EnrollmentId>> Handle(EnrollStudentInCourseCommand request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Business logic implementation
    }
}
```
````

### Query Example:

```csharp
public class GetStudentTranscriptQuery : IRequest<StudentTranscriptDto>
{
    public StudentId StudentId { get; }
}

public class GetStudentTranscriptQueryHandler : IRequestHandler<GetStudentTranscriptQuery, StudentTranscriptDto>
{
    public async Task<StudentTranscriptDto> Handle(GetStudentTranscriptQuery request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Query implementation
    }
}
```

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Traditional Repository Pattern

- **Pros**: Simpler implementation, familiar to team
- **Cons**: Mixing of read and write concerns, harder to optimize

### 2. Direct Controller-to-Service Architecture

- **Pros**: Minimal abstraction, direct data access
- **Cons**: Controllers become heavy, business logic scattered

### 3. Event Sourcing with CQRS

- **Pros**: Complete audit trail, time-travel capabilities
- **Cons**: Significantly more complex, overkill for current requirements

## Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Implement core enrollment operations with CQRS
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate existing services to command/query handlers
3. **Phase 3**: Optimize queries with read-specific data models
4. **Phase 4**: Implement event-driven communication between bounded contexts

## Success Metrics

- Command operation response time < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Query operation response time < 100ms (95th percentile)
- Unit test coverage > 85% for handlers
- Developer productivity maintained during transition

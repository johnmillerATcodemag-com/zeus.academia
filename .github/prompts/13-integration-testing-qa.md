       // Test enrollment affects schedule, billing, gradebook, reporting
   }

   [Test]
   public async Task GradeEntry_Should_Propagate_To_All_Dependent_Systems()
   {
       // Test grade entry affects GPA, academic standing, alerts
   }
   ```

2. **Cross-System Data Flow**

   ```csharp
   [Test]
   public async Task AcademicCalendar_Changes_Should_Affect_All_Scheduling()

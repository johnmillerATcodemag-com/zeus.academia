## Verification Steps

### Component-Level Verification

1. **Scheduling Service Tests**

   ```csharp
   [Test]
   public async Task ScheduleCourse_Should_Detect_Time_Conflicts()
   {
       // Test time conflict detection algorithm
   }

   [Test]
   public async Task EnrollStudent_Should_Validate_Prerequisites()
   {
       // Test enrollment with prerequisite checking
   }

   [Test]
   public async Task OptimizeSchedule_Should_Minimize_Room_Conflicts()
   {
       // Test schedule optimization algorithms
   }
   ```

2. **Enrollment Service Tests**

   ```csharp
   [Test]
   public async Task EnrollWithCapacityLimit_Should_Create_Waitlist()
   {
       // Test waitlist creation when course is full
   }

   [Test]
   public async Task DropCourse_Should_Promote_From_Waitlist()
   {
       // Test automatic waitlist promotion
   }
   ```

3. **Conflict Detection Tests**
   ```csharp
   [Test]
   public void DetectScheduleConflicts_Should_Find_All_Overlaps()
   {
       // Test comprehensive conflict detection
   }
   ```

### Integration Testing

1. **End-to-End Enrollment Flow**

   - Course search → Prerequisite check → Enrollment → Schedule confirmation
   - Waitlist placement → Automatic enrollment → Notification
   - Drop/add with schedule validation

2. **Schedule Management Flow**

   - Course planning → Room assignment → Faculty assignment → Student enrollment
   - Schedule changes → Conflict resolution → Stakeholder notification
   - Semester transitions with data migration

   - Student academic standing affects enrollment eligibility
   - Course prerequisites validated against student transcripts

### Performance Testing

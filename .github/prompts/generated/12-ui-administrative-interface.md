## Verification Steps

### Component-Level Verification

1. **User Management Tests**

   ```javascript
   describe("Administrative User Management", () => {
     test("should create bulk users with appropriate roles", async () => {
       // Test bulk user creation workflow
     });

     test("should handle role permission assignments correctly", async () => {
       // Test role-based permission system
     });
   });
   ```

2. **System Configuration Tests**

   ```javascript
   describe("System Configuration", () => {
     test("should update academic policies and propagate changes", async () => {
       // Test policy configuration changes
     });

     test("should manage academic calendar with validation", async () => {
       // Test calendar management
     });
   });
   ```

3. **Administrative Dashboard Tests**
   ```javascript
   describe("Administrative Dashboard", () => {
     test("should display accurate institutional metrics", async () => {
       // Test dashboard data accuracy
     });

       // Test performance with large datasets
     });
   });
   ```

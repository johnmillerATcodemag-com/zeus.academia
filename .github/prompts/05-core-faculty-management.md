## Verification Steps

### Component-Level Verification

1. **Faculty Service Tests**

   ```csharp
   [Test]
   public async Task CreateFaculty_Should_Assign_Appropriate_Rank()
   {
       // Test faculty creation with rank assignment
   }

   [Test]
   public async Task PromoteFaculty_Should_Update_Rank_And_Notify()
   {
       // Test promotion process with notification
   }

   [Test]
   public async Task AssignCourse_Should_Check_Teaching_Load()
   {
       // Test course assignment with load validation
   }
   ```

2. **Faculty API Tests**

   ```csharp
   [Test]
   public async Task GetFacultyByDepartment_Should_Return_Department_Faculty()
   {
       // Test department-based faculty filtering
   }

   [Test]
   public async Task SearchFacultyByExpertise_Should_Return_Matching_Faculty()
   {
       // Test expertise-based search
   }
   ```

3. **Hierarchy Tests**
   ```csharp
   [Test]
   public void Chair_Should_Have_Department_Administrative_Access()
   {
       // Test hierarchical permissions
   }
   ```

### Integration Testing

1. **Faculty Lifecycle Management**

   - New hire → Rank assignment → Department assignment → Course assignment → Promotion
   - Committee assignments and service tracking
   - Administrative role transitions

2. **Cross-System Integration**

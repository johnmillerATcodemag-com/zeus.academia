## Verification Steps

### Component-Level Verification

1. **Authentication Tests**

   ```javascript
   describe("Student Authentication", () => {
     test("should login with valid credentials", async () => {
       // Test login functionality
     });

     test("should handle token refresh automatically", async () => {
       // Test token refresh mechanism
     });
   });
   ```

2. **Course Enrollment Tests**

   ```javascript
   describe("Course Enrollment", () => {
     test("should prevent enrollment without prerequisites", async () => {
       // Test prerequisite validation
     });

     test("should show waitlist option when course is full", async () => {
       // Test waitlist functionality
     });
   });
   ```

3. **Grade Display Tests**
   ```javascript
   describe("Grade Dashboard", () => {
     test("should calculate GPA correctly", () => {
       // Test GPA calculations
     });

     test("should show degree progress accurately", () => {
       // Test degree progress calculations
     });
   });
   ```

## � Step-by-Step Demonstration Guide

### Prerequisites for Demo

1. **Start All Services** (Backend API + Faculty Dashboard + Student Portal):

   ```bash
   cd c:\git\zeus.academia
   .\start-zeus-academia.ps1
   ```

   This will start:

   - Backend API: http://localhost:5000/
   - Faculty Dashboard: http://localhost:5174/
   - Student Portal: http://localhost:5173/

2. **Alternative: Start Faculty Dashboard Only**:

   ```bash
   cd c:\git\zeus.academia
   .\start-zeus-academia.ps1 -FacultyOnly
   ```

   This starts only the Backend API and Faculty Dashboard.

3. **Demo Login Credentials** (must exist in backend database):

   ```
   Primary Demo Account:
   Email: professor@zeus.academia
   Password: FacultyDemo2024!
   Role: Professor

   Admin Demo Account:
   Email: dean@zeus.academia
   Password: AdminDemo2024!
   Role: Dean/Administrator

   Note: These accounts must be created in the Zeus Academia backend
   database before the demo. If they don't exist, use the localStorage
   simulation approach in Step 2.2 Option B to demonstrate the frontend
   authentication system.
   ```

4. **Required Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, or Edge (latest versions)
5. **Screen Resolution**: Recommended 1920x1080 for optimal desktop experience
6. **Demo Duration**: Approximately 15-20 minutes

### 🔧 **Troubleshooting Demo Issues**

**Issue**: CORS Error (blocked by CORS policy) or API Connection Refused
**Solution**:

```bash
# Stop any existing services
cd c:\git\zeus.academia
.\stop-zeus-academia.ps1

# Start all services (includes Faculty Dashboard on port 5174)
.\start-zeus-academia.ps1

# Or start Faculty Dashboard only
.\start-zeus-academia.ps1 -FacultyOnly
```

**Note**: The backend API has been updated to allow CORS requests from Faculty Dashboard (port 5174). If you still see CORS errors, ensure the backend API has been restarted after the update.

**Issue**: Development server not starting
**Solution**:

```bash
cd c:\git\zeus.academia\src\Zeus.Academia.FacultyDashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Issue**: CORS + Internal Server Error (500) during login
**Solution**:

1. **First, fix CORS**: Backend API updated to allow Faculty Dashboard port 5174
2. **Restart backend**: Stop and restart API to apply CORS changes
3. **Check API health**: Navigate to http://localhost:5000/health
4. **Demo users**: For immediate demo, use localStorage simulation (Step 2.2 Option B)

**Issue**: Login not working with demo credentials
**Solution**:

1. Ensure backend API is running on port 5000
2. Verify endpoint is accessible at: http://localhost:5000/api/authentication/login
3. Demo credentials must exist in the backend database
4. Check that the user account is active and not locked out

**Issue**: Vue DevTools not showing
**Solution**: Install Vue DevTools browser extension or demonstrate architecture in VS Code

**Issue**: Responsive view not working
**Solution**: Use DevTools Device Toolbar or resize browser window manually

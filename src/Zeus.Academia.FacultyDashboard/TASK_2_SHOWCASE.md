## � STAKEHOLDER DEMONSTRATION GUIDE

### 🚀 Getting Started

#### Prerequisites & Setup Options

**Option A: Full System Demo (Recommended)**

1. **Start the Backend Services**:
   ```bash
   cd c:\git\zeus.academia
   .\start-zeus-academia.ps1
   ```
2. **Start the Frontend Dashboard**:
   ```bash
   cd c:\git\zeus.academia\src\Zeus.Academia.FacultyDashboard
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Open Browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5175` (or the port shown by npm run dev)

**Option B: Frontend-Only Demo (Component Testing)**

- If backend services are unavailable, the application will show CORS errors for authentication
- Components and UI can still be demonstrated through direct navigation
- Mock data is available for testing individual components

#### ⚠️ Important Setup Notes

- **Backend Required**: Full authentication demo requires running backend API services
- **CORS Configuration**: Ensure backend allows requests from `http://localhost:5175` (or your current frontend port)
- **Database Setup**: Backend should be configured with demo user accounts

### 👤 Demo User Accounts (Backend Required)

| Role                | Email                   | Password | Access Level               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| Dean                | dean@academia.edu       | demo123  | Full Administrative Access |
| Department Chair    | chair@academia.edu      | demo123  | Department Management      |
| Professor           | professor@academia.edu  | demo123  | Full Faculty Features      |

## �️ **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 🚫 **CORS Error (Most Common)**

**Error**: `Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:5000/api/authentication/login' from origin 'http://localhost:5175' has been blocked by CORS policy`

**Solutions**:

1. **Start Backend Services**: Run `.\start-zeus-academia.ps1` in the main repository
2. **Check Backend Port**: Ensure backend is running on `localhost:5000`
3. **Verify CORS Configuration**: Backend must allow `http://localhost:5175` (or your current frontend port)

#### 🔐 **Authentication Bypass for Demo**

If backend is unavailable, manually set authentication in browser console:

```javascript
// Open browser dev tools (F12) and run:
localStorage.setItem("zeus_faculty_auth", "true");
localStorage.setItem("zeus_faculty_token", "demo-token-12345");
localStorage.setItem("zeus_faculty_role", "professor");
localStorage.setItem(
  "zeus_faculty_user",
  JSON.stringify({
    id: "1",
    email: "professor@academia.edu",
    firstName: "Jane",
    lastName: "Smith",
    role: "professor",
    department: "Computer Science",
    title: "Professor",
    permissions: ["view_courses", "manage_grades", "view_students"],
  })
);
// Then refresh the page
```

#### 🔄 **Alternative Demo Routes**

Navigate directly to these routes for component demonstration:

- `/profile` - Faculty Profile Management
- `/schedule` - Office Hours (if implemented)
- `/committees` - Committee Management (if implemented)
- `/dashboard` - Main Dashboard
